This repository showcases my personal journey in learning backend development with Node.js, Express, and Mongoose. It includes my implementations of authentication and authorization, CRUD operations using Mongoose, dynamic routing, and rendering views with EJS. Additionally, it covers my experiments with cookies and sessions for user state management, and form handling. This repo reflects my progress and understanding of building server-side applications.
