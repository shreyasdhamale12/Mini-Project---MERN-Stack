# Backend-Development-Learning
This repository demonstrates my learning in backend development with Node.js, Express, and Mongoose. It includes examples of authentication and authorization, CRUD operations, dynamic routing, EJS templating, cookies and sessions, and form handling. This project reflects my progress in building and managing server-side applications.
